Thoughts about the code:

I read code line by line and found eloquent model related issues.
Many queries in code uses incorrect eloquent orm so i refactored the code.
Other issues i faced related to conditional statements and unnecessary usage of code.
So i removed that code from controller and repository. 
Mostly developers use Carbon in laravel to handle dates related operation so i refcactor the code.
Overall code was ok but incorrect usage of conditional statements ,Eloquent Orm etc make code terribale 
So i refactor the code.
If you privde me Models than it was more easy for me to refactor more code in detail.
